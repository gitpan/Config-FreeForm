    Config::FreeForm

I<Config::FreeForm> provides in-memory configuration data
in a free-form manner. Many existing configuration modules
attempt to provide some structure to your configuration
data; in doing so, they force you to use their own
configuration paradigm (association of keywords with values,
etc.). Often this isn't what you need in a complex
application--you need complete control over your configuration
data, and you need the ability to structure it however you
like. This is what I<Config::FreeForm> gives you.

In I<Config::FreeForm> configuration data is stored as a
Perl data structure. The logic behind this is that you know
Perl--you shouldn't need to learn another little language
to set up your configuration data, however simple that
language may be.
